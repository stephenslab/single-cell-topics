Data preparation
----------------

These pages detail the steps taken to prepare the single-cell RNA-seq
data sets for topic modeling analysis.

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](prepare_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](prepare_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet](prepare_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](prepare_pulseseq.html)

Assess Poisson NM model fits
----------------------------

In these pages, we compare the quality of the Poisson NMF fits with
different updates (EM, CCD, SCD, with and without extrapolation), and
with different settings for $K$.

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](assess_fits_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](assess_fits_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet](assess_fits_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](assess_fits_pulseseq.html)

Identify clusters
-----------------

In these pages, we identify clusters of cells from the mixture
proportions.

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](clusters_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](clusters_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet](clusters_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](clusters_pulseseq.html)

Visualize and annotate topics
-----------------------------

In these pages, we annotate topics and substructures to determine
their biological relevance. This includes performing a differential
expression analysis using the topic model.

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](plots_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](plots_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet and pulse-seq](plots_tracheal_epithelium.html)

Examine single-cell likelihoods
-------------------------------

*Add description here.*

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](loglik_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](loglik_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet](loglik_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](loglik_pulseseq.html)

Other analyses
--------------
