Data preparation
----------------

These pages detail the steps taken to prepare the single-cell RNA-seq
data sets for topic modeling analysis.

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](prepare_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](prepare_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet](prepare_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](prepare_pulseseq.html)

Assess model fits
-----------------

In these pages, we compare the quality of the Poisson NMF fits with
different updates (EM, CCD, SCD, with and without extrapolation), and
with different $k$.

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](assess_fits_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](assess_fits_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet](assess_fits_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](assess_fits_pulseseq.html)

Identify clusters
-----------------

In these pages, we perform PCA on the estimated topic proportions, and
use this to identify clusters.

+ [Mixture of FACS-purified PBMCs](clusters_purified_pbmc.html)

+ [PBMC 68k](clusters_68k_pbmc.html)

+ [Droplet](clusters_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](clusters_pulseseq.html)

Perform differential expression analysis
----------------------------------------

In these pages, we perform a differential expression analysis using
a topic model and clusters identified from this topic model.

+ [Droplet](diff_count_droplet.html)

+ [Pulse-seq](diff_count_pulseseq.html)

Visualize and interpret topics
------------------------------

*TO DO: Add brief description here.*
