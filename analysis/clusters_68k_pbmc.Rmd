Here we perform PCA on the topic proportions to identify clusters in
the 68k PBMC data.

```{r knitr-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",collapse = TRUE,results = "hold",
                      fig.align = "center",dpi = 120)
```

Load the packages used in the analysis below, as well as additional
functions that we will use to generate some of the plots.

```{r load-pkgs, message=FALSE}
library(Matrix)
library(dplyr)
library(fastTopics)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
source("../code/plots.R")
```

Load the count data.

```{r load-data}
load("../data/pbmc_purified.RData")
```

Load the $K = 6$ Poisson NMF model fit.

```{r load-fit}
fit <- readRDS(file.path("../output/pbmc-purified/rds",
                         "fit-pbmc-purified-scd-ex-k=6.rds"))$fit
```
