This is a more systematic comparison of the fastTopics DE analysis
with MAST and DESeq2 based on an
x[initial smaller simulation](de_analysis_detailed_look.html). The
results were generated using the `run_sims.R` script, and here we
summarize the results.

```{r knitr-opts, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#",collapse = TRUE,results = "hold",
                      fig.show = "hold",fig.align = "center",dpi = 120)
```
