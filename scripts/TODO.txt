to do next:
----------

+ Figure out how large a PBMC data set DESeq2 can handle, and run
  DESeq2 on that data set, separately for each cell type.

+ make some improvements to de_analysis in de-overhaul-2 branch.

+ Run de_analysis on that PBMC data set with enough Monte Carlo
  samples to get reliable z-score estimates.

+ Compare DESeq2 and fastTopics results on PBMC data.

+ Clean up code and data files in analysis/ and scripts/ directories.
